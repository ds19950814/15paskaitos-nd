     <p>Shinoda and Delson’s band Xero went through a couple of lineup changes prior to meeting Bennington. Once they settled on him as their new vocalist, they changed their name to Hybrid Theory, to describe the musical fusion they created. They eventually had to change their name again because of a Welsh electronic group called Hybrid. Thus, they settled on using the phrase for the album’s title.</p>

       <p>Linkin Park auditioned and were rejected for record deals 44 (yes, forty-four) times before finally being accepted by Warner Brothers and becoming one of the biggest musical acts of the past two decades. In fact, Warner Brothers had rejected Linkin Park three times before they finally signed them.</p>

       <p>In 1996, three school friends—Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson—recruited Joe Hahn, Dave “Phoenix” Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to record a 4-track demo tape in Shinoda’s makeshift bedroom studio. This tape is considered the first thing ever created by Linkin Park, who was still known as Xero at the time.</p>
